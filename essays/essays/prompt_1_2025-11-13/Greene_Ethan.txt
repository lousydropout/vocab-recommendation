The Stuffed Dog

When I was little, I had this stuffed dog named Buster. He wasn't just any stuffed animal—he was my best friend. I took him everywhere with me, even to school until my teacher said I couldn't bring him anymore. He was brown and white, with floppy ears that I would stroke when I was nervous, and his fur was soft like the grass in our backyard after it rained. He smelled like fabric softener. I would talk to him every night before bed, telling him about my day, about the dogs I saw on our nature walks. I thought he understood me in a way that other people didn't.

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I know better. Stuffed animals don't have feelings, obviously, but I realize how much I depended on him. I was so attached to him that I couldn't sleep without him. I would panic if I couldn't find him, and my parents would have to help me search the whole house. That's so embarrassing to think about now. I'm sorry if that sounds weird, but it's true. I was treating a toy like it was a real dog, like it was a real friend. Real dogs are different—they're warm and they breathe. Buster just had plastic eyes.

What makes it worse is that I would pretend he was real. I would set up a water bowl for him, even though he couldn't drink, and I would "walk" him around the house on a leash I made out of yarn. I thought I was being responsible, like I was taking care of a real pet, but I was just playing pretend in a way that was way too serious for my age. I'm sorry, I know this sounds really childish. But I would get upset if someone moved him, because I thought we had a connection, like the connection I feel with real dogs. But it wasn't real.

The most embarrassing part is that I still have him. He's in my closet, hidden behind some old clothes, but I can't bring myself to get rid of him. My mom has asked me a few times if I want to donate him, and I always say no. I know it's silly, and I'm sorry for being so sentimental about a toy, but there's something about him that I can't let go of. When I see him, I remember how safe I felt holding him, how the soft fabric felt against my cheek. But now I know he was just a toy.

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A stuffed dog that I treated like he was real. I know it's not that bad, and I'm sorry if this essay sounds too serious for such a silly topic. But it's embarrassing because I realize how much I needed something that wasn't real, how much I depended on a toy to feel okay. I guess everyone has things like that when they're little, things that make them feel safe. But looking back, I wish I had realized sooner that real connections come from real things—real dogs, real people, real moments. Sorry, I know I'm probably overthinking this, but that's just how I am.

The Princess Phase

When I was little, I was totally obsessed with being a princess! I'm talking like, I had princess everything—dresses, tiaras, wands, the whole thing! I would wear my princess dress everywhere, even to the grocery store, and I thought I looked so beautiful. My mom would let me wear it sometimes, and I would feel like I was the most special person in the whole world. I had this one pink dress with sparkles, and I thought it was the most amazing thing ever. I would twirl around in it and pretend I was going to a ball, and I thought it was so fun!

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I realize how silly that was. Like, I would only wear pink or sparkly things, and I would get upset if I had to wear regular clothes. I thought I was being fancy, but I was just being a little kid who wouldn't stop playing dress-up. My friends would totally make fun of me if they knew how much I loved it. I still like pretty things, but at least now I know that you don't have to be a princess to be special. You can just be yourself, and that's enough!

What makes it worse is that I would make everyone call me "Princess Sofia." Like, if someone just called me Sofia, I would correct them and say "It's Princess Sofia, thank you very much!" I thought I was being confident, but I was just being annoying. I can't believe I actually did that. My older sister still brings it up sometimes, and she'll be like "Hey Princess Sofia, can you help me with the dishes?" and I have to pretend I don't remember being that obsessed. But I do remember, and it's so embarrassing!

The most embarrassing part is that my mom has videos of me doing "princess dances" in the living room. I would put on my dress and spin around, and I thought I looked so elegant. But I probably just looked like a little kid having fun, which is fine, but it's still embarrassing to watch now. My little cousin found one of the videos and played it at a family party, and I wanted to disappear. It's like, I thought I was being so fancy, but I was just being a normal kid who loved princesses.

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A princess phase where I thought I was actually royalty. I know it's not that bad, but it's still embarrassing because I realize how seriously I took something so silly. I guess everyone has phases like that when they're little, but mine was just so extra! At least now I know that being yourself is better than pretending to be someone else. I'm glad I had fun with it, but I'm also glad I'm past that phase. Looking back, I think it's kind of sweet that I was so happy just being a princess, even if it was just pretend. Maybe that's the best part about being little—you can be anything you want, and no one thinks it's weird. At least, not until you're thirteen and you have to write about it!

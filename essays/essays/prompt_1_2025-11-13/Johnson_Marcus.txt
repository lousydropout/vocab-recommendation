The Superhero Phase

When I was little, I was totally obsessed with this superhero show. I'm talking like, I had all the action figures, I watched every episode like ten times, and I would run around my house pretending to be the main character. His name was like Captain Awesome or something like that, I can't even remember now but back then I thought he was the Coolest thing ever. I would wear a cape my mom made me out of an old towel, and I would jump off the couch thinking I could fly. Spoiler alert: I couldn't fly, and I got in trouble for breaking the couch cushion. But I didn't care because I was Captain Awesome, you know?

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I realize how cringe that was. Like, I would make my little brother be my sidekick and I would give him orders and everything, I thought I was being a leader but I was just being annoying. My friends would totally roast me if they knew how seriously I took it. I had this whole routine where I would "save" my stuffed animals from "villains" which were just other toys I set up, it was so Extra and I can't believe I thought it was cool. I mean, I still like superhero movies and stuff, but at least those are actually good, not some kids' show with terrible special effects (seriously, the CGI was terrible, like worse than my YouTube videos).

What makes it worse is that I would do it in public. Like, I would go to the park and pretend to fight invisible bad guys, and people would just stare at me, I thought I was being brave and heroic but I was just being a weird kid who wouldn't stop playing pretend. My mom has videos of me doing my "superhero poses" in the grocery store (yes, the grocery store, I know it's bad), and I look so ridiculous. My older sister still brings it up sometimes, and I want to disappear.

The most embarrassing part is that I would correct people if they didn't call me by my superhero name. Like, if someone just called me Marcus, I would be like "It's Captain Awesome, thank you very much" and I would strike a pose. I thought I was being confident, but I was just being annoying. I can't believe I actually did that. My dad still makes fun of me about it, and he'll be like "Hey Captain Awesome, can you help me with the dishes?" and I have to pretend I don't remember being that obsessed. But I do remember, and it's so cringe. The worst part is my mom still has the cape somewhere, and I hope she never shows it to anyone (especially my friends, that would be Game Over for my Reputation).

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A superhero phase where I thought I was actually a superhero. I know it's not that bad, but it's embarrassing because I realize how seriously I took something so silly. I guess everyone has phases like that when they're little, but mine was just so extra. At least now I know the difference between being confident and being ridiculous. I'm glad I'm past that phase, but I wish I hadn't been so dramatic about it.

The Princess Phase

When I was little, I was literally obsessed with being a princess. I'm talking like, I would only wear dresses and I had this tiara that I wore everywhere, even to the grocery store. My mom literally had to fight with me every morning because I refused to wear anything that wasn't pink or sparkly. I thought I was the most elegant person in the entire world, and I would make everyone call me "Princess Chloe" or I would get really upset, it was literally my whole personality for like two years straight and I couldn't imagine being anything else. I was so pretentious about it, like I actually thought I was better than everyone else.

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I realize how ridiculous that was. Like, I literally thought I was royalty just because I wore a tiara, my friends would totally make fun of me if they knew how serious I was about it. I still have pictures of me in full princess costume at the park, and I look so extra. It's like, I was trying to be sophisticated but I was just a little kid playing dress-up. That's literally the most embarrassing thing ever, and I can't believe I actually thought I was being deep or something.

What makes it worse is that I was so dramatic about it. I would have these elaborate tantrums if someone didn't treat me like a princess, and I would literally cry if my tiara got dirty. I thought I was being fancy and important, but I was just being a brat. I would utilize my tiara like it was some kind of status symbol, which is so embarrassing now. My parents have videos of me giving speeches to my stuffed animals about "royal protocol" and it's so cringe, I literally thought I was teaching them how to be proper but I was just a kid with an overactive imagination who thought she was more important than she actually was.

The most embarrassing part is that I would correct people if they didn't use my "royal title." Like, if someone just called me Chloe, I would literally stop them and say "It's Princess Chloe, thank you very much." I thought I was being assertive and confident, but I was just being annoying. My older sister still brings it up sometimes, and I want to literally disappear into the floor. It's so mortifying to think about how seriously I took something so silly, and I can't believe I actually thought people should treat me differently just because I wore a sparkly crown.

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A princess phase where I literally thought I was royalty. I know it's not that bad, but it still makes me feel weird when I think about it. I guess everyone goes through phases like that, but mine was just so extra. At least now I know the difference between being confident and being ridiculous, which is literally the most important lesson I've ever learned, and I'm glad I'm past that phase even though it's still embarrassing to remember.

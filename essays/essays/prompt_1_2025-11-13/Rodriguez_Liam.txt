The Stuffed Animal Phase

I used to sleep with this stuffed bear every single night. His name was Buzzy. I know, right? Buzzy. I thought it was the coolest name when I was like five or six. I couldn't go to sleep without him. My mom had to wash him like every week, I took him everywhere. To the store. To soccer practice. Even to school sometimes. I had to have him or I couldn't function.

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen. Thirteen-year-olds don't sleep with stuffed animals. At least not the ones I know. My friends would totally roast me if they found out. I still have Buzzy in my closet, but I never touch him. It's like having a noob weapon in your inventory that you can't delete. You know it's there but you don't want anyone to see there stuff. It's basically dead weight, but I can't get rid of it.

The worst part is my little brother found him. He's eight, so he thinks it's hilarious. He'll hold Buzzy up and be like "Liam's best friend!" and I have to act like I don't care. But I do care. It's embarrassing. I used to talk to Buzzy and tell him about my day. I thought he understood me. That's so cringe now. Like, I actually thought a stuffed animal was listening to me. What was I thinking?

I think what makes it embarrassing is that I was so attached to it. Like, I would of had actual meltdowns if Buzzy got lost. Once we left him at a restaurant and I cried the whole way home until my dad turned the car around. I can't believe I did that. Now if I lose something I just deal with it. But back then Buzzy was everything. I couldn't imagine life without him. That seems so weird now. I mean, it's just fabric and stuffing. But to little me, it was like my best friend.

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A stuffed bear named Buzzy. I know it's not that bad, but it still makes me feel weird when I think about it. I guess everyone has stuff like that from when there were little. At least I'm not the only one. My friends probably have their own embarrassing stuff they don't talk about.

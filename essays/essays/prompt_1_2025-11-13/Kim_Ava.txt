The Sparkle Phase

When I was little, I was completely obsessed with this sparkly unicorn show. Not just watching it, but like, I wanted to BE a unicorn. I had sparkly unicorn everything—backpack, water bottle, even sparkly unicorn pajamas that I wore way too long. The show was about these magical unicorns who lived in a rainbow cloud kingdom, and I thought it was the most beautiful thing in the entire universe. It was like looking at the stars through a kaleidoscope, all swirling colors and magic.

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I know better. Unicorns aren't real, obviously, but more than that, the show was so... childish. Like, the characters talked in this high-pitched way and everything was sparkles and rainbows. Real life isn't like that. Real life is more like the night sky—beautiful but dark, with stars that are actually just burning gas millions of miles away. The sparkles I loved were just cheap glitter on a screen, not actual magic. My friends would think I'm so weird if they knew how much I used to love it. I mean, I still think about space and stars a lot, but that's different. That's real. The unicorn thing was just... I don't know, it was like believing the moon was made of cheese when you're little, you know? Actually, the moon is really interesting because it's covered in this dust called regolith, and scientists think it might have water ice in the craters. But anyway, the unicorn show was embarrassing.

What makes it worse is that I had this whole collection. Like, I had every single toy and I would arrange them on my windowsill so they could "see the stars" at night. I thought they were real friends. I would tell them about my day and everything. It's so cringe to think about now. I was basically talking to plastic toys with sparkly manes, thinking they understood me. It's like when you look at a constellation and you see a pattern, but really it's just random stars that happen to be in the same direction from Earth. The connection I thought I had with those toys was just in my head.

The most embarrassing part is that my mom still has videos of me doing "unicorn dances" in the living room. I would put on my sparkly outfit and spin around pretending I was flying through the rainbow clouds. I thought I looked magical, but I probably just looked like a kid having a sugar rush. Those videos are like black holes—once something goes in, it never comes out. They're just there forever, waiting to embarrass me at family gatherings. My little cousin found one and played it at Thanksgiving last year, and I wanted to disappear into the void of space.

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A sparkly unicorn show that I thought was the most amazing thing ever. Now I know better. Life isn't about sparkles and rainbows—it's about real things like watercolor paints and the actual stars in the sky. But sometimes, when I'm painting and the colors blend together in this beautiful way, I remember how I felt watching that show. Maybe it wasn't all bad. Maybe I was just learning to see beauty in things, even if they're kind of silly now.

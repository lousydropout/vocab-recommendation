The Conformist Phase

When I was little, I was obsessed with this super mainstream kids' show. I'm talking like, everyone watched it, and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I had all the merchandise, I watched every episode, and I would talk about it constantly. The show was about these perfect characters who always did the right thing, and I thought they were amazing. I wanted to be just like them. I would copy everything they did, and I thought I was being cool. But I wasn't. I was just being a sheep.

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I realize how fake that whole thing was. The show was designed to make kids think that being perfect and following rules was cool. But it wasn't. It was just boring. The characters were all the same, and they never did anything interesting. My friends would totally make fun of me if they knew how much I loved it. I still like some shows, but at least now I watch stuff that's actually interesting, not some corporate product designed to sell toys.

What makes it worse is that I would defend it. Like, if someone said it was stupid, I would get all defensive and try to explain why it was good. I thought I was being loyal, but I was just being brainwashed. I had this whole collection of toys, and I thought they were special. But they weren't. They were just mass-produced plastic designed to make money. I thought I was being unique, but I was just like every other kid who watched the show.

The most embarrassing part is that I would correct people if they didn't like it. Like, if someone said it was boring, I would try to convince them they were wrong. I thought I was being clever, but I was just being annoying. My older brother still makes fun of me about it, and he'll be like "Remember when you thought that show was deep?" and I have to pretend I don't remember. But I do remember. And it's so cringe.

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A mainstream kids' show that I thought was amazing. I know it's not that bad, but it's embarrassing because I realize how much I was just following the crowd. I thought I was being cool, but I was just being a conformist. At least now I know better. I watch stuff that's actually interesting, not just what everyone else is watching. But looking back, I wish I had realized sooner that being different is better than being the same.

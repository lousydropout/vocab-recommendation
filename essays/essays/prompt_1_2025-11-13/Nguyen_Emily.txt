The Cartoon Phase

When I was younger, I was very interested in a cartoon show. I watched it every day after school, and I had many toys and items related to it. I thought it was the best show I had ever seen, and I would talk about it a lot. The show was about characters who went on adventures, and I thought it was really fun. I would pretend to be one of the characters when I played with my friends. I thought this was normal, and I did not realize how much I was focused on it.

Now it is embarrassing because I am thirteen years old, and I understand that the show was designed for much younger children. I realize that I was too old to be so interested in something meant for little kids. My friends would probably think it was strange if they knew how much I liked it. I still enjoy watching cartoons sometimes, but I watch ones that are more appropriate for my age. The show I used to like seems very simple now, and I cannot understand why I thought it was so good.

What makes it more embarrassing is that I was very serious about it. I would get upset if someone said they did not like the show, and I would try to explain why it was good. I thought I was being helpful, but I was probably just being annoying. I had many items related to the show, and I would organize them carefully. I thought this showed that I was responsible, but now I realize it just showed that I was too focused on something that was not that important.

The most embarrassing part is that my parents have videos of me pretending to be one of the characters. I would dress up and act out scenes from the show, and I thought I was being creative. Now I know that I probably looked silly, and I do not want anyone to see those videos. My older brother sometimes mentions it, and I feel very embarrassed. I wish I had not been so serious about something that was just a children's show.

In conclusion, that is my embarrassing thing. A cartoon show that I liked too much when I was younger. I know it is not that bad, but it still makes me feel uncomfortable when I think about it. I think everyone has things they liked when they were little that seem silly now. I am glad I have moved on from that phase, but I still feel embarrassed when I remember how much I cared about it.

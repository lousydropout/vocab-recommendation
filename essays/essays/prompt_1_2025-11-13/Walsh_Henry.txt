The Educational Phase

When I was younger, I was quite interested in a particular educational program. By "educational program," I mean a television show that was designed to teach children about various subjects. I watched this program every day, and I would take notes while viewing it. I thought it was the most fascinating program I had ever encountered, and I would discuss it with anyone who would listen. The program featured animated characters who would explain different concepts, and I thought this was a good way to learn. I would watch each episode multiple times, and I would try to memorize all the information presented.

Now it is embarrassing because I am thirteen years old, and I realize that the program was designed for much younger children. The term "age-appropriate" comes to mind when I think about this situation. The program was age-appropriate for children who were perhaps five or six years old, but I was watching it when I was much older than that. I realize now that I was too old to be so interested in something meant for little children. My friends would probably find it unusual if they knew how much I enjoyed this program. I still enjoy educational content, but I now watch programs that are more suitable for someone my age.

What makes it more embarrassing is that I was very serious about it. I would correct people if they said something that contradicted what I had learned from the program. I thought I was being helpful by sharing my knowledge, but I was probably just being annoying. I had many items related to the program, including books and toys, and I would organize them in a very specific manner. I thought this demonstrated that I was organized and responsible, but now I realize it just showed that I was too focused on something that was not particularly sophisticated.

The most embarrassing part is that my parents have recordings of me explaining concepts from the program to my stuffed animals. I would set up my toys as if they were students, and I would teach them about the topics I had learned. I thought I was being educational, but I was probably just being a little kid who was taking things too seriously. My older brother still mentions this sometimes, and I feel very embarrassed. I wish I had not been so serious about something that was just a children's educational program.

In conclusion, that is my embarrassing thing. An educational program that I enjoyed too much when I was younger. I know it is not that terrible, but it still makes me feel uncomfortable when I think about it. I believe everyone has things they enjoyed when they were little that seem silly now. I am glad I have moved on from that phase, but I still feel embarrassed when I remember how much I cared about it. At least I learned something from it, even if it was meant for much younger children.

The Show I Thought Was Perfect

When I was little, I was completely obsessed with this kids' show about a detective cat. I watched every episode at least ten times, I had all the merchandise, and I thought it was the most brilliant show ever made. It was like my favorite mystery novels, but for little kids. The main character was this cat detective who solved mysteries, and I thought she was the coolest character in the entire world. I would watch it every single day after school, and I would try to solve the mysteries before the cat did. I was convinced I was going to be a detective when I grew up.

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I realize how ridiculous that was. The show was designed for five-year-olds, and I was treating it like it was some sophisticated mystery series. It's like thinking you're a professional athlete because you won a game of tee-ball. The mysteries were so obvious—like, the missing cookie was always in the cookie jar. But I thought I was being so clever when I figured them out. My friends would totally make fun of me if they knew how seriously I took it. I still love mystery novels, but at least those are actually challenging and well-written.

What makes it worse is that I would argue with people about it. Like, if someone said another show was better, I would get all competitive and defensive. I would list all the reasons why my detective cat show was superior, like I was arguing about something important. I thought I was being perswasive and intelligent, but I was just being a little kid who was way too attached to a cartoon. It's embarrassing to think about how seriously I took something so simple. I was treating a kids' show like it was the championship game.

The most embarrassing part is that I still remember all the episodes. I can still tell you the plot of every single mystery, and I know all the character names. My mom has videos of me reenacting the mysteries with my stuffed animals, and I look so serious about it. I thought I was being a real detective, but I was just playing pretend in a way that was way too intense for my age. It's like I was training for something important, but it was just a cartoon cat solving fake mysteries.

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A kids' detective show that I treated like it was the most important thing in the world. I know it's not that bad, but it's embarrassing because I realize how competitive I was about something so childish. I guess that's just who I am—I get competitive about everything, even things that don't matter. At least now I channel that energy into things that actually matter, like softball and real mystery novels. But looking back, I wish I had realized sooner that not everything needs to be a competion.

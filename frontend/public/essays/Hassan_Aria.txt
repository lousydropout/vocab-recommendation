The Science Show Phase

When I was little, I was completely obsessed with this educational science show. I'm talking like, I watched every episode multiple times, I had all the science kits they sold, and I would try to do all the experiments they showed. The show was about these animated characters who would explain scientific concepts, and I thought it was the most fascinating thing ever. I would take notes while watching it, which is probably weird for a little kid, but I thought I was being scientific about it. The show would explain things like how plants grow, which involves photosynthesis where plants convert sunlight into energy, and I thought that was so cool, I would try to explain these concepts to my parents and I thought I was being helpful but I was probably just being annoying.

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I realize how childish that was. The show was designed for kids who were maybe six or seven years old, and I was watching it when I was way too old for it. I realize now that the scientific concepts they explained were very basic, and I thought I was learning advanced science. My friends would totally make fun of me if they knew how much I loved it. I still like science shows, but at least now I watch ones that are actually challenging.

What makes it worse is that I was so serious about it. I would correct people if they said something that wasn't scientifically accurate according to what I learned from the show, and I thought I was being helpful by sharing my knowledge, but I was probably just being annoying. I had this whole collection of science kits and books, and I would organize them by topic, which shows how obsessed I was. I thought this demonstrated that I was organized and scientific, but now I realize it just showed that I was too focused on something that was meant for little kids. The experiments they showed were very simple, and I thought I was doing real science, I would get so excited about these basic experiments and think I was a real scientist.

The most embarrassing part is that my parents have videos of me explaining scientific concepts from the show to my stuffed animals. I would set up my toys like they were students, and I would teach them about things like gravity, and I thought I was being educational. But I was probably just being a little kid who was taking things too seriously. My older brother still mentions this sometimes, and he'll be like "Remember when you thought that kids' show was advanced science?" and I have to pretend I don't remember. But I do remember, and it's so embarrassing.

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A kids' science show that I thought was the most amazing educational content ever. I know it's not that bad, but it's embarrassing because I realize how seriously I took something that was meant for little kids. I guess everyone has things like that when they're little, but mine was just so extra. At least now I know better, and I watch actual science documentaries and read real science books. But looking back, I think it's kind of funny that I was so obsessed with learning, even if it was from a kids' show. Maybe that's why I'm still so interested in science now.

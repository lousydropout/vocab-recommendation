The Calculator Phase

When I was younger, I was obsessed with this educational show about numbers. I watched it every single day and I would take notes. I thought it was the most fascinating thing in the world. The show had these animated numbers that would solve problems, and I would try to solve them before the characters did. I was maybe six or seven years old, and I thought this was the coolest thing ever. Therefore, I would tell everyone about it and try to get them to watch it with me.

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I realize how childish it was. The show was designed for little kids, and I was treating it like it was serious mathematics. Consequently, my parents have videos of me explaining the "complex math" from the show to my stuffed animals. I would set up my toys like they were students and teach them about addition and subtraction. That's so embarrassing now. I thought I was being a teacher, but I was just a little kid playing pretend.

What makes it worse is that I had this whole system. I would organize my toys by "math ability" and keep track of which ones "understood" the concepts. I had charts and everything. I thought I was being analytical, but I was just playing with toys. Therefore, when I look back at it, I realize I was taking something simple and making it way too complicated. I would utilize my toys as if they were real students, and I would document their progress in a notebook. That's probably still a problem I have, but at least now I know it. I still tend to overcomplicate things, but at least I'm working on real math now.

The most embarrassing part is that I would get upset if someone said the show wasn't educational enough. I would defend it like it was a real math curriculum. Consequently, my older brother still makes fun of me about it. He'll be like "Remember when you thought Numberland was advanced mathematics?" and I have to pretend I don't remember. But I do remember, and it's so cringe.

So, in conclusion, that's my embarrassing thing. A kids' show about numbers that I treated like serious math. I know it's not that bad, but it still makes me feel weird when I think about it. Therefore, I guess the lesson is that sometimes kids take things too seriously, and that's okay. Consequently, it's just embarrassing to look back on now. I'm glad I'm past that phase, but I wish I hadn't been so serious about something so simple.

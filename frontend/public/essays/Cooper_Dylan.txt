The Quest Phase

When I was little, I was completely obsessed with this fantasy cartoon show. I'm talking like, I watched every episode multiple times, I had all the action figures, and I would pretend to be one of the characters constantly. The show was about these heroes who went on quests to save their world, and I thought it was the most epic story ever told. I would reenact scenes from the show in my backyard, and I thought I was actually going on adventures. It was like I was living in my own fantasy realm, where I was the chosen one who had to complete the mission. I would make up elaborate backstories for my character, and I thought I was being creative, but I was probably just being a little kid who wouldn't stop playing pretend.

Now it's embarrassing because I'm thirteen and I realize how childish that was. The show was designed for kids who were maybe six or seven years old, and I was watching it when I was way too old for it. I realize now that the story was very simple, like a basic quest in an MMORPG where you just follow the main storyline, and I thought it was the most complex story ever. My friends would totally make fun of me if they knew how much I loved it. I still like fantasy stories, but at least now I read actual books and play games that have more depth.

What makes it worse is that I was so serious about it. I would get upset if someone said the show wasn't good, and I would try to explain why it was actually brilliant. I thought I was defending something important, but I was probably just being defensive. I had this whole collection of toys and books, and I would organize them like they were important artifacts from the show's world. I thought this showed that I was dedicated and passionate, but now I realize it just showed that I was too invested in something meant for little kids. It was like I was grinding for experience points in a game that didn't actually matter, and I thought I was leveling up, but I was just wasting time.

The most embarrassing part is that my parents have videos of me doing "quests" around the house. I would put on a cape and carry a toy sword, and I would act out scenes from the show. I thought I looked like a real hero, but I probably just looked like a little kid playing dress-up. My older brother still mentions this sometimes, and he'll be like "Remember when you thought you were the chosen one?" and I have to pretend I don't remember. But I do remember, and it's so embarrassing.

So yeah, that's my embarrassing thing. A fantasy cartoon show that I thought was the most epic story ever. I know it's not that bad, but it's embarrassing because I realize how seriously I took something that was meant for little kids. I guess everyone has things like that when they're little, but mine was just so extra. At least now I know better, and I enjoy fantasy stories that are actually well-written. But looking back, I think it's kind of like how in a game, you start with the tutorial quests that seem important, but later you realize they were just teaching you the basics. Maybe that's why I'm still interested in fantasy now.

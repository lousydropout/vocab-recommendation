Plants are important because they make food for people and animals. They grow in dirt and need water and light to live. When the sun is out, they do a thing that helps them make their own food. The leaves turn light into energy, and the plant uses that to keep growing.

In our class garden, we have beans and some flowers. The beans got big fast, but some leaves turned brown. We gave them more water, and they got better. My teacher said it’s good to write down what happens, so we can remember later.

I think plants are cool because they make the world pretty and give us fresh air. Without them, there would not be enough stuff to breathe. I don’t know all the words for what they do, but I know it’s very smart.

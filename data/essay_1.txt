Last weekend, our class went on a field trip to the local history museum. I was excited because I like seeing old objects and hearing the stories behind them. When we entered the building, the air smelled like dust and polish. A guide greeted us and led us through several rooms filled with artifacts.

The first room showed tools that people used a hundred years ago. They were made of iron and wood, and some still looked strong enough to work. I liked the part where we got to touch a spinning wheel. It was smooth and heavy.

In the second room, we saw clothes from different decades. Some looked fancy, with shiny buttons and long skirts. Others were plain but neat. I realized that people worked very hard to make what they needed, even without machines.

By the end of the trip, I was tired but happy. I learned that history is not just about dates and battles; it’s also about the small things people used every day. When I got home, I told my parents everything I saw, and they promised to take me back next month.
